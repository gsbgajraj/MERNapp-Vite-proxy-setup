# 🚀 Vite + React Proxy Setup

Welcome to the **Vite + React** project with a proxy server configuration! This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool and React for the frontend. Below is a brief explanation of the configuration provided.

## 🛠️ Project Setup

This project is configured using the `vite.config.js` file, which includes the necessary settings to enable a proxy server. Here's the setup:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:5000',
        changeOrigin: true,
        rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, '/api')
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## 📜 Explanation

- **Plugins**: We are using the official React plugin for Vite (`@vitejs/plugin-react`), which enables support for React's JSX syntax and other related features.

- **Server Proxy**:
  - The `proxy` object is configured to handle requests that start with `/api`.
  - These requests are proxied to `http://localhost:5000`, which typically represents your backend server.
  - `changeOrigin: true` ensures the host header of the proxied request matches the target.
  - The `rewrite` function modifies the request path, replacing `/api` at the start of the path with `/api`.

## 💻 Usage

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the Vite server with the proxy configuration enabled. Any API requests made to `/api/*` will be forwarded to `http://localhost:5000/api/*`.
